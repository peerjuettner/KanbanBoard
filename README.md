## Overview

This is a simple Kanban app, originally created as part of a code challenge, hence the non-use of icons or ui-librarys.
It was extended after the original creation by adding Typescript and other small corrections.
The App was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository and run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies.
After installation, run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
If a browserwindow doesn't open, you can manually navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the running app.
